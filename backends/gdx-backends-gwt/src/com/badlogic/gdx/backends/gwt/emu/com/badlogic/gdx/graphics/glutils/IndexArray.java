 * In IndexBufferObject wraps OpenGL's index buffer functionality to be used in conjunction with VBOs. This class can be
 * seamlessly used with OpenGL ES 1.x and 2.0.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Uses indirect Buffers on Android 1.5/1.6 to fix GC invocation due to leaking PlatformAddress instances.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can also use this to store indices for vertex arrays. Do not call {@link #bind()} or {@link #unbind()} in this case but
 * rather use {@link #getBuffer()} to use the buffer directly with glDrawElements. You must also create the IndexBufferObject with
 * the second constructor and specify isDirect as true as glDrawElements in conjunction with vertex arrays needs direct buffers.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * VertexBufferObjects must be disposed via the {@link #dispose()} method when no longer needed
 * </p>
